1.) Git is a version control system that is used to manage the changes in the files & folders your code is written in (codebase) in a way that enables the changes you make to be tracked over time. It also makes code being worked on by multiple people available in a centralized location. GitHub is a public place to host repositories (repos), which are essentially folders that use Git to track changes to the folders and files and folders within. It's a place to store and save your code, as well as track its progress, development, and changes over time. It also serves as a collaborative platform, which allows other users to work on your codebase.

2.) We use the terminal in order to communicate to the computer more directly than using a GUI. We can create project folders and different file structures, list the contents of our directory, and move both files and folders around.

3.) With version control, we can track our work, manage the changes in our codebase, allows multiple people to work on the files which people can make changes or revert to a previously working code if the current version does not work.
